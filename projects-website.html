	<p>In order to make this website, I went through the whole UX design process. Here are all the documents I recorded!</p>

		<div class="projectDescriptionRight">
			<p>
			Ideation process for finding a "quirk" for the website. I settled on the background image quirk. The background picture includes me only on the home page.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageRight" src="images/webUX/webUX_2.PNG"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionLeft">
			<p>
			For pages such as this one,I wanted to decide on a format where I could prettily display images and text in an interesting way. I decided that horizontal "containers" would work best, but I still have reservations on making the images jump left and right rather than all on one side. 
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageLeft" src="images/webUX/webUX_3.PNG"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionRight">
			<p>
			Here, I was deciding how to best position the navigation bar on the page. I felt that the bar could easily go on any side. But when I took the photos for the background of the website, I decided I would rather crop out the left side of the photo rather than the top or bottom.
			</p>

	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageRight" src="images/webUX/webUX_4.PNG"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionLeft">
			<p>
			A more in-depth view of the home page. I wanted to draw out a little more detail with the decisions which had been made so that I could better visualize what the site would look like, and so that I would have additional guidance for when I would mock up the page. 
			</p>
		</div>

	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageLeft" src="images/webUX/webUX_5.PNG"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionRight">
			<p>
			A more in-depth view of a page which needed more content on it. I decided I would not add myself in the background of this page.
			</p>
		</div>

			Additional thumbnails from trying out different views on how to space items on a page, drawn with a little more care and detail than on the original pages.

		<div class="projectDescriptionRight">
			<p>
			The higher-fidelity mockup for the home screen which I made using UX Pin. Trying out the side navigation bar made me realize I didn't like how the first option was squished against the top of the screen, so I decided to add a flair just to take up some space and help with layout.
			</p>

	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageRight" src="images/webUX/uxpin_homeHover.png"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionLeft">
			<p>
			I added interactions in UX Pin so that I could decide on what color I wanted the buttons to turn whlie the user was hovering over them. This is a screenshot of me hovering over the "Resume" option.
			</p>

	<hr>
	<div class="projectContainer">
		<img class="projectImageLeft" src="images/webUX/uxpin_resume.png"/>
		<div class="projectDescriptionRight">
			<p>
			I also made a wireframe of pages which need some more content. I wanted to work with the spacing, though I decided that a general idea was good enough, and I would wait to use the photos I took to actually decide on the final background spacing.

			Once everything was planned out, I built the site using Adobe Dreamweaver. This meant that I could finally roll out the site!
